The paper considers the general problem of estimating the probability of rare events, with real examples of such problems arising in bioinformatics. Rare events are events that occur with a low frequency and have a very small probability of occurrence. To simulate random variables and estimate the probabilities of rare events of interest to us, it is very time consuming and computational power to use the usual approaches, for example, the Monte Carlo method. It is proposed to use a class of algorithms based on the markov chains Monte Carlo method: importance sampling approach, the Wang-Landau algorithm, the replica exchange, and the stochastic approximation Monte Carlo.

The paper considers two examples from the field of bioinformatics. The first example is the estimation of the probability of coincidence of strings in the task of sequences alignment. In the second example, the problem of evaluating statistical significance of peptide spectrum matches in database search.

It is empirically shown that the estimates lie within the confidence intervals of the Monte Carlo estimates and have a lower variance compared to it, which allows us to conclude that the estimates obtained are correct and more accurate.
